# 🏥 Hospital Data Analytics Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing hospital operational data to uncover actionable insights into patient admissions, length of stay, satisfaction levels, and readmission trends. By leveraging **SQL** for querying and **Excel dashboards** for visualization, the project delivers a holistic view of hospital performance and patient care efficiency.  

---

## 🎯 Goals  
- Monitor and analyze **average length of stay (ALOS)** for patients.  
- Track **patient satisfaction scores** and identify areas for improvement.  
- Evaluate **admission vs. readmission rates** to improve treatment quality.  
- Provide management with **real-time dashboards** for decision-making.  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes anonymized hospital records with the following fields:  
- `Patient_ID` – Unique identifier for each patient  
- `Admission_Date` – Date of admission  
- `Discharge_Date` – Date of discharge  
- `Department` – Department/ward admitted to  
- `Satisfaction_Score` – Patient survey score (1–5 scale)  
- `Readmission_Flag` – Indicates if the patient was readmitted within 30 days  
- `Cost_of_Treatment` – Total billing cost  

 

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL)** → Data cleaning, querying, aggregation  
- **Excel Dashboards** → KPI tracking, charts, and reporting  
- **PivotTables & Power Query** → Data modeling and preprocessing  

---

## 📊 Key Analysis  
1. **Average Length of Stay (ALOS)** – Measured per department & hospital-wide  
2. **Patient Satisfaction** – Trends across demographics and departments  
3. **Readmission Rates** – Root cause analysis of frequent readmissions  
4. **Financial KPIs** – Revenue per patient, cost distribution by department  

---

## 🚀 Workflow  
1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation** (SQL queries)  
2. **KPI Calculation** (ALOS, Satisfaction, Readmission)  
3. **Dashboard Creation in Excel** with PivotCharts, Slicers & KPIs  
4. **Insights & Recommendations** presented to stakeholders  

---

## ✅ Results & Insights  
- Identified that **average length of stay was higher** in the Cardiology department.  
- Found that **low satisfaction scores correlated** with longer waiting times.  
- Discovered that **20% of patients accounted for 60% of readmissions**, indicating chronic disease management gaps.  

---

## 📦 Requirements  
- Excel 2019 / Office 365  
- MySQL / PostgreSQL (for queries)  
- Sample hospital dataset (CSV/SQL dump)  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements  
- Extend dashboards to **Power BI / Tableau** for interactive reporting.  
- Build a **predictive model for readmission risk** using Python ML libraries.  
- Integrate with real-time hospital systems for automated updates.
